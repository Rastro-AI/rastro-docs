```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find product specifications",
    "items": [{"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"}],
    "output_schema": [
      {"name": "price_usd", "type": "number", "description": "Current retail price in USD"},
      {"name": "weight_grams", "type": "number", "description": "Product weight in grams"}
    ]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "original_data": {"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"},
      "enriched_fields": {
        "price_usd": {
          "value": 999,
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro"]
        },
        "weight_grams": {
          "value": 187,
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs"]
        }
      },
      "all_sources": ["https://apple.com/..."]
    }
  ],
  "total_items": 1,
  "successful": 1
}
```

That's it. Every enriched field includes its source URL.
