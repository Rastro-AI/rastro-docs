## 1. Get your API key

[dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys](https://dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys) → Create New Key → Copy it.

## 2. Run a flow

Flows are built in the [Rastro dashboard](https://dashboard.rastro.ai). Once you have one, execute it via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/workflows/YOUR_FLOW_ID/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": [{"sku": "ABC", "title": "My Product"}]}'
```

## 3. Check results

```bash
curl https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/workflows/runs/RUN_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..."
```

That's it.
