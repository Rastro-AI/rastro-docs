## 1. Get your API key

[dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys](https://dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys) → Create New Key → Copy it.

## 2. Enrich your data

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find product specifications and pricing",
    "items": [{"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"}]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "original_data": {"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"},
      "enriched_fields": {
        "price": {
          "value": "$999",
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/iphone-15-pro"]
        },
        "specs": {
          "value": {"chip": "A17 Pro", "display": "6.1 inch"},
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs"]
        }
      },
      "all_sources": ["https://apple.com/iphone-15-pro"]
    }
  ],
  "total_items": 1,
  "successful": 1
}
```

That's it. Every enriched field includes its source URL.
