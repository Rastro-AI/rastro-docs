## 1. Get your API key

[dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys](https://dashboard.rastro.ai/settings/api-keys) → Create New Key → Copy it.

## 2. Start an enrichment job

```bash
curl -X POST "https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/enrich" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find product specifications",
    "items": [{"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"}],
    "output_schema": [
      {"name": "price", "type": "string", "description": "Current retail price"},
      {"name": "weight", "type": "string", "description": "Product weight with units"}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "running"
}
```

## 3. Poll for results

Enrichment typically takes ~2 minutes. Query the job ID to check status:

```bash
curl "https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/enrich/job_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..."
```

**Response (when complete):**

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "original_data": {"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"},
      "enriched_fields": {
        "price": {
          "value": "$999",
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-15-pro"]
        },
        "weight": {
          "value": "187 grams",
          "sources": ["https://apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs"]
        }
      },
      "all_sources": ["https://apple.com/..."],
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "total_items": 1,
  "successful": 1
}
```

Every enriched field includes its source URL.

<Tip>
**Want faster results?** Add `"speed": "fast"` for quicker but less thorough enrichment.
