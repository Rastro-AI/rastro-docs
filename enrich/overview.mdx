Rastro's Enrich API finds and extracts product information from across the web.

## How it works

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Sony WH-1000XM5",
    "fields": ["price", "description", "specs", "images"]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "query": "Sony WH-1000XM5",
  "results": {
    "price": 349.99,
    "description": "Industry-leading noise canceling headphones...",
    "specs": {
      "driver_size": "30mm",
      "battery_life": "30 hours",
      "weight": "250g"
    },
    "images": [

    ]
  },
  "sources": ["sony.com", "amazon.com"]
}
```
