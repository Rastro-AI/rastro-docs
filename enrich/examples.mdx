Use Enrich when you want Rastro to research products on the web and fill in missing data. Rastro scrapes manufacturer sites, extracts specs, and tracks sources for every field.

## Basic enrichment

Find product specifications from the web:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/catalogs/{catalog_id}/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Find product specifications and dimensions"}'
```

## Enrich specific items

Only enrich certain products:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/catalogs/{catalog_id}/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find pricing from manufacturer websites",
    "item_ids": ["item_123", "item_456"]
  }'
```

## Thorough research

Use slow mode for more comprehensive results:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/catalogs/{catalog_id}/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find detailed technical specifications",
    "speed": "slow"
  }'
```
