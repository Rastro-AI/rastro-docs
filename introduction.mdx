## Why Rastro?

### Dynamic Schemas
Unlike traditional PIMs with rigid schemas, Rastro automatically evolves your catalog schema as you add new fields. No migrations, no downtime.

```json
// Add any field - schema evolves automatically
{
  "sku": "LAPTOP-001",
  "title": "Pro Laptop",
  "custom_field": "This field is automatically added to the schema"
}
```

### AI-Powered Enrichment
Run sophisticated AI workflows to enrich product descriptions, categorize products, extract specifications from documents, and more.

### Multi-Channel Ready
Export to Shopify, sync with your ERP, or build custom integrations. Rastro is designed for modern commerce.
