## What is Rastro?

Rastro is the fastest way to enrich and transform catalog data to launch products faster. Simply define the information you need and what you have, and receive it with citations.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/enrich" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find product specifications",
    "items": [{"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"}],
    "output_schema": [
      {"name": "price", "type": "string", "description": "Current retail price"},
      {"name": "weight", "type": "string", "description": "Product weight with units"}
    ]
  }'
```

Every field comes with its source URL so you know where the data came from.
