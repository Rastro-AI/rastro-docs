## What is Rastro?

Rastro finds product information on the web and returns structured data with source citations. Send us your products, tell us what to find, and get back enriched data.

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/enrich \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Find specifications and pricing",
    "items": [{"name": "iPhone 15 Pro"}]
  }'
```

Every field comes with its source URL so you know where the data came from.
