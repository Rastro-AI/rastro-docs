Flows are reusable data pipelines you build visually, then execute via API or dashboard. Perfect for recurring enrichment tasks.

## 1. Create a flow from a template

1. Go to [dashboard.rastro.ai/flows](https://dashboard.rastro.ai/flows)
2. Click **Templates**
3. Select **Competitor Pricing**
4. Upload your CSV
5. Click **Run**

That's it — your flow will process each row and enrich it with competitor pricing data.

## 2. Execute via API

Once you have a flow, you can also trigger it programmatically.

Get your Flow ID from the URL: `dashboard.rastro.ai/flows/{FLOW_ID}/edit`

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/workflows/{FLOW_ID}/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": [
      {"sku": "A1", "title": "Product A"},
      {"sku": "A2", "title": "Product B"}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "workflow_run_id": "run_abc123",
  "status": "running"
}
```

## 3. Check status and get results

```bash
curl https://catalogapi.rastro.ai/api/public/workflows/runs/run_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rastro_pk_..."
```

**Response (when complete):**

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "results": {
    "data": [
      {"sku": "A1", "title": "Product A", "enriched_field": "..."},
      {"sku": "A2", "title": "Product B", "enriched_field": "..."}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Flows vs Enrich API

| Feature | Enrich API | Flows |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Setup | None | Build in dashboard |
| Best for | One-off enrichment | Recurring pipelines |
| Customization | Prompt + schema | Full visual editor |
| Processing | Synchronous | Async with status polling |

-> [Execute endpoint](/flows/execute) | [Status endpoint](/flows/status)
